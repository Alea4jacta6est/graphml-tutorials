# Transfer Learning of Molecular Property Prediction 

This tutorial consists of i) Pre training with multi regression task on topological indices; ii) Fine tuning for property prediction task. We use transfer learning because data for the primary, property prediction, task is usually highly imbalanced. In other words, there is an abundance of data with label 0 and lack of data with label 1. In order to overcome this class imbalance, we pre train with multi regression task on prediction three set of topological indices, {wiener index, hyper wiener index, zagreb index}. Studies have found that there is a strong correlation between molecular topology and chemical properties such as boiling point, toxicity CITE. For example, wiener index is highly correlated with boiling point. To transfer the model to property prediction task, we simply remove the last  output layer of the pre trained neural network and replace with  a new output layer. Because pre training on multi regression task on topological indices is self supervised learning, it is also useful for large, unlabeled molecule data.
