# An Introduction to Graph Neural Networks

#### Author: Payal Chandak (payal.chandak@columbia.edu)

## Overview

Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful tool to learn representations from any arbitrary graph structure by leveraging local network neighborhoods. This tutorial aims to:
  1. Introduce the concept of graph neural networks
  2. Discuss the quatitative motivation behind different GNN architectures
  3. Implement these architectures using the PyTorch Geometric library. 

## Usage

To view, download and open `gnn-intro.html`. To run the code and edit, download and open the `gnn-intro.ipynb`. 

## Requirements

Recent versions of NumPy, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric and Jupyter are required. All the required packages can be installed using the following command: 

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
