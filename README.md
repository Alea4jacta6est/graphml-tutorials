## Overview

Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful tool to learn representations from any arbitrary graph structure by leveraging local network neighborhoods. These tutorials aim to:
  1. Introduce the concept of graph neural networks.
  2. Discuss the theoretical motivation behind different GNN architectures.
  3. Provide implementations of these architectures. 
  4. Apply the architectures to key prediction problems on interconnected data in science and medicine. 

## Usage

To start, download and open `01-intro/gnn-intro.html`. To run the code and edit, download and open the `01-intro/gnn-intro.ipynb`. 

## Requirements

Recent versions of NumPy, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric and Jupyter are required. All the required packages can be installed using the following command: 

## Installation 

1. `git clone https://github.com/mims-harvard/graphml-tutorials.git`
2. `cd graphml-tutorials`
3. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. `conda activate graphml_venv`
